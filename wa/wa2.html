    <p id="self-desc" style = "font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> 
        Hello! My name is Lilly and I am an aspiring Software Developer. 
        Currently, I am in my 3nd year of my undergraduate education, majoring in Computer Science.
        I'm passionate about diversity and how technology can improve the livelihoods of underrepresented communities.
        Outside of school, I am involved with SASE (Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers) and love to cook, crochet, and play the guitar.
        I am open to internship roles for Summer 2024.

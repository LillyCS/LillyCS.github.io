    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> 
        Hello! My name is Lilly <em>(she/her/hers)</em> and I am an aspiring <em>Technical Consultant</em>. 
        Currently, I am in my <strong>4th year</strong> of my undergraduate education, majoring in Computer Science. I'm also pursuing an
        accelerated master's degree in Data Science.
        Outside of school, I am involved with SWE (Society of Women Engineers) and love to cook, crochet, and play the guitar.

    <h3>Goals for Web</h3>
    <p>
        I hope by the end of this class to strengthen my web development skills and build a really cool personalized website!
        I would love to take more creative approaches to web design and utilize the concepts of this class to build something
        I can be proud of!

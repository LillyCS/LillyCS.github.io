    <h3>China</h3>

      <p>In China during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> (618-907), tea leaves were steamed and formed into compressed tea (tea bricks) 
        for storage and trade. According to Lu Yu's The Classic of Tea (760-762), tea was first made by roasting compressed tea 
        in solid form over a fire and then grinding it in a wooden grinder called a <em>niǎn</em> (碾, Japanese: yagen), then boiling water in a pot, 
        adding salt when it boils, then adding the tea powder to the boiling water and boiling it until it foamed.
        The tea was also sometimes mixed with green onions, ginger, jujubes, mandarin orange peels, Tetradium ruticarpum, and mint.
        <br>
        <br>
        During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_dynasty">Song Dynasty</a> (960-1279), the method of making powdered tea from steam-prepared dried tea leaves and preparing the beverage by whipping the tea powder and hot water together in a bowl became popular.

    <h3>Japan</h3>
        <p>The first documented evidence of tea in Japan dates to the 9th century. It is found in an entry in the Nihon Kōki having to do with the Buddhist monk Eichū (永忠), who is thought to have brought some tea back to Japan on his return from China. 
            The entry states that Eichū personally prepared and served sencha (煎茶) to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Saga">Emperor Saga</a>, who was on an excursion in Karasaki (in present Shiga Prefecture) in 815. This sencha is thought to be Chinese compressed tea, not sencha as we know it today, 
            in which tea leaves are steeped in hot water to extract the ingredients.[19] By imperial order in 816, tea plantations began to be cultivated in the Kinki region of Japan. However, the interest in tea in Japan faded after this.

            Matcha (抹茶) is generally believed to have been introduced to Japan from the Song Dynasty (China) by Zen monk Eisai in 1191, along with tea seeds. He wrote Kissa Yōjōki (喫茶養生記 'book of drinking tea for curing') and presented it to Minamoto no Sanetomo, the third shogun of the Kamakura Shogunate, in 1214. 
            At that time, tea was considered a kind of medicine.
        </p>

    <h2 id="grades">Grades</h2>
      <p>Until the Edo period (1603-1867), the production of matcha (<em>tencha</em>) was monopolized by tea growers in Uji, Kyoto. The best brands of matcha at that time were <em>Baba Mukashi</em> (祖母昔), <em>Hatsu Mukashi</em> (初昔), and <em>Ato Mukashi</em> (後昔), which were offered to the shogun. Uji tea growers still sell these brands today.
        Today, various tea stores sell their own grades of brand-name teas. <br>
        <br>
        Although there are no clear standards for matcha grades by the Japanese government or tea industry associations, there is a traditional distinction between <em>ichiban-cha</em> (一番茶, 'first tea') and niban-cha (二番茶, 'second tea'). Ichiban-cha is the first tea of the year, plucked in late April to late May. Niban-cha is the second tea plucked about 45 days after ichiban-cha is plucked.<br>
        <br>
        Of the following terms "ceremonial grade" is not recognised in Japan but "food grade" or "culinary grade" are.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ceremonial grade</strong> designates tea for its use in tea ceremonies and Buddhist temples. All must be able to be used in koicha (濃茶), a "thick tea" with a high proportion of powder to water used in traditional tea ceremony. Ceremonial is the finest and purest form of matcha.</li>
        <li><strong>Premium grade</strong> is high-quality matcha green tea that contains young tea leaves from the top of the tea plant. Best for daily consumption, it is characterized by a fresh, subtle flavor, usually perfect for both new and everyday matcha drinkers alike.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooking/culinary grade</strong> is the cheapest of all. Suitable for cooking purposes, smoothies etc. It is slightly bitter due to factors such as its production from leaves lower down on the tea plant, terroir, the time of harvest, or the process of its manufacture.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In general, matcha is expensive compared to other forms of green tea, although its price depends on its quality. Higher grades are pricier due to the production methods and younger leaves used, and thus they have a more delicate flavor.
